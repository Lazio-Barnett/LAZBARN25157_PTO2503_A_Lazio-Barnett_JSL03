# 📌 JSL03 – Console-Based Task Manager

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds on my JSL02 work by taking the task manager further. Now I can add up to **three new tasks** to an existing task list. Each task is saved as an object with its own unique ID. I enter details using prompts, and the console shows all tasks plus a filtered view of just the completed ones.

## ✨ Features

- Tasks stored as objects inside an array for easy management
- Add up to three new tasks on top of the starter tasks
- Unique incremental ID assigned to each new task
- Prompts ask for task title, description, and status
- Alert if I try to add more than three new tasks:
  _"There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console."_
- Console shows **all tasks** and also a separate list for **completed tasks**
- Clear labels in the console to keep things readable
